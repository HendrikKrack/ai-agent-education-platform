# Current Projects Summary

## Primary Project: AI Agent Education Platform

You are currently working on an **AI Agent Education Platform** - an innovative educational platform that allows teachers to create business simulations with AI agents to help students learn through interactive scenarios.

### Project Overview
- **Type**: Full-stack web application
- **Purpose**: Educational technology for business simulations
- **Status**: Recently released as open source (initial commit: "feat: initial open source release of AI Agent Education Platform")

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19 with TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Vite
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy
- **AI Services**: OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude
- **Additional Tools**: PDF processing, WebSocket for real-time interactions

### Key Features
- **Scenario Management**: Pre-defined business scenarios, PDF case study uploads, custom scenario creation
- **AI Agent Creation**: Intelligent agents with unique personalities and expertise areas
- **Interactive Simulations**: Real-time business simulations with multi-agent collaboration
- **Modern UI/UX**: Professional design system with accessibility features

### Project Structure
- `frontend/` - React TypeScript application
- `backend/` - FastAPI Python application with database models and AI services
- Configuration files for development setup
- Comprehensive documentation (README.md, architecture_plan.md)

### Development Environment
- **Git Status**: Clean working tree on branch `cursor/identify-current-projects-1705`
- **Setup Scripts**: Development setup automation (`setup_dev.py`, `start_dev.py`)
- **Dependencies**: Python requirements.txt, Node.js package.json files

### Current Development Phase
Based on the architecture plan, the project appears to be in early stages with core components being developed:
1. Basic scenario creation and agent setup
2. AI-powered agent responses and simulation engine
3. PDF analysis and advanced customization (future)
4. Analytics and assessment tools (future)

### Project Inspiration
The platform is inspired by modern AI-driven education approaches, similar to companies like n-aible, and is designed to serve educators and students worldwide.

## Additional Context
- The workspace contains development templates and configuration files
- There's a comprehensive roadmap for future features including mobile app, VR/AR integration, and LMS integration
- The project includes proper documentation for contributors and deployment guidelines
